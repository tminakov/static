# Arrow Selection & Tuning Guide
*A Reference for Indoor & Outdoor Barebow Archery*

---

## Introduction

This guide combines both theoretical understanding and practical experience in selecting and tuning arrows for **barebow recurve archery**. 
It covers:
- **Shafts** — how spine, material, and diameter influence flight.
- **Points** — how weight impacts dynamic spine, stability, and grouping.
- **Vanes** — aerodynamic effects of size, height, and stiffness.
- **Other factors** — riser considerations, barebow-specific tuning, maintenance.

It is based on tuning work for a **37 lb draw weight (on the fingers)**, 30.5" arrow length, **600–650 spine carbon shafts**, and focuses on **18m indoor barebow shooting**.

## 1. Shafts

### 1.1 Theoretical Background
The arrow shaft serves as the flexible beam between the bowstring and the target. 
Its most important characteristics:

#### Spine
- Measured as the **deflection** (in thousandths of an inch) under a standard load (1.94 lbs at 28" span).
- **Lower number = stiffer shaft** (e.g., 500 is stiffer than 700).
- Dynamic spine is affected by:
 -- Shaft length — longer = weaker.
 -- Point weight — heavier = weaker.
 -- String material & brace height — faster release stiffens dynamic spine.

#### Material
- **Carbon**: light, straight, durable, immune to bending, consistent.
- **Aluminium**: heavier, easy to bend, but precise and good for indoor line-cutting.
- **AC hybrids**: combine aluminium core with carbon wrap; expensive but top-tier performance.

#### Diameter (ID / OD)
- Smaller OD reduces wind drag, but in indoor archery large OD increases line-cutting potential.
- ID determines component compatibility (nocks, points, pin systems).

### 1.2 Practical Indoor Shaft Selection

**For 18m Barebow (your specs)**:
- Material: **Full carbon** preferred for durability.
- OD: **6–7.5 mm** for line-cutting advantage without excessive wind drag.
- Spine: 650 (± one step) for your draw weight and length.
- Shaft length: Keep at full draw length + ~1–1.5 cm to allow tuning flexibility.

**Example Shaft Models**
| Brand | Model | Spine Options | OD | ID | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------------|----|----|-------|
| Victory | VAP V1 | 600, 650, 700 | ~5.6 mm | 4.2 mm | High precision, small OD, 5.5 GPI |
| Victory | VFT | 600 | ~7.3 mm | ~6.2 mm | High precision, large OD, 6.6 GPI |
| Fivics | TenPro | 600, 650 | ~6.0 mm | 4.2 mm | Affordable, consistent, 7.4 GPI |
| Gas Pro | GS Indoor | 600, 650 | 7.2 mm | 4.2 mm | Large OD, indoor focus |
| Skylon | Paragon | 600, 650 | ~4.8 mm | 3.2 mm | Good ACE alternative, small OD, 6.1 GPI |

## 2. Points

### 2.1 Theory

**Role of the point**:
- Adds mass to the arrow front.
- Affects arrow flex during acceleration.
- Changes **Front of Center (FOC)** balance — higher FOC improves stability, lower FOC increases speed.

**Dynamic spine effect**:
- More point weight = arrow bends more = weaker dynamic spine.
- This can make an arrow group tighter at short range but slower overall.

**Optimal indoor tuning**:
- Slightly weaker dynamic spine is often more forgiving indoors.
- High FOC helps the arrow “settle” faster in flight.

---

### 2.2 Practical Data

**Your setup example**:
- 30.5" VFT 600 spine carbon shaft.
- 120 grain points for indoor stability.

| Point (gr) | Dynamic Spine Shift* | Speed | Forgiveness |
|------------|----------------------|-------|-------------|
| 80         | +0.004" stiffer | Highest | Lowest |
| 100        | ~Neutral | High | Balanced |
| 120        | -0.006" weaker | Medium | High |
| 140        | -0.009" weaker | Lowest | Very High |

\*approximate deflection change from baseline

**Basis Of Data**

- Baseline for reading vendor charts: your **37 lb** on fingers + **~4 lb** barebow adjustment ⇒ **41 lb** “chart draw weight” at **120 gr**, **30.5"**.
    
-  **Point-weight effect**: about **1 lb per 10 grains** (heavier point = behaves **weaker**; lighter point = **stiffer**).
    
-  **Length effect**: about **5 lb per 1.0"** of arrow length. So **30.0"** is **~2.5 lb stiffer** than **30.5"** (all else equal).
    
*   **30.5" table** (baseline):
    
    *   120 gr → **41 lb** (neutral)
        
    *   110 gr → **40 lb** (slightly stiffer)
        
    *   100 gr → **39 lb** (stiffer)
        
    *   90 gr → **38 lb** (stiffer)
        
    *   80 gr → **37 lb** (noticeably stiffer)
        
*   **30.0" table** (0.5" shorter, so stiffer by ~2.5 lb across the board):
    
    *   120 gr → **38.5 lb** effective
        
    *   110 gr → **37.5 lb**
        
    *   100 gr → **36.5 lb**
        
    *   90 gr → **35.5 lb**
        
    *   80 gr → **34.5 lb**
        

**How to use this**

*   If your 30.5" / 120 gr build tunes well now, dropping to **100 gr** makes it act about **2 lb stiffer** on the spine chart; **80 gr** is about **4 lb stiffer**.
    
*   Shortening to **30.0"** plus lighter points stacks the effect: e.g., **30.0" + 100 gr** behaves ~**4.5 lb stiffer** than the 30.5"/120 gr baseline.
    

These are **tuning-bench equivalents**, not a physics simulation—but they match common coach practice and should get you very close on first try.



**Mass & FOC**
- Total mass rises ~10 gr for each +10 gr point step (as expected).
- FOC increases by ~0.9–1.0% per +10 gr point.
-- Example (30.5"): ~10.1% FOC at 80 gr → ~14.3% at 120 gr.
-- Shortening to 30.0" bumps FOC slightly at the same point weight (same front mass over shorter lever).

**Speed & 18 m drop (simple, same-bow energy model)**
- Using a practical recurve baseline (180 fps at 300 gr), speed scales with 1/√mass.
- Going 80 → 120 gr slows the arrow ~6–7 fps and adds roughly 6–7 cm more drop at 18 m.
-- Example (30.5"):
--- 80 gr ~ 176 fps, drop ≈ 52.5 cm
--- 120 gr ~ 169 fps, drop ≈ 59.6 cm
-- 30.0" versions are a touch lighter/faster and drop slightly less at each point weight.

**How to use this**
- If you’re chasing a forgiving indoor tune, the 110–120 gr points give you ~13–14% FOC with smoother launch, at the cost of ~7 cm more 18 m drop vs. 80 gr.
- If you want a flatter sight picture, 80–90 gr gains you a few fps and ~5–7 cm less drop, but dynamic spine stiffens accordingly (as shown earlier).

## 3. Vanes

### 3.1 Theory

**Purpose**: Vanes stabilise the arrow by creating drag and rotational spin. 
They must balance:
- Clearance (avoiding contact with rest, riser, or tab).
- Aerodynamic stability.
- Minimal speed loss.

**Variables**:
- **Length**: Longer vanes give more stability but more drag.
- **Height**: Higher vanes catch more air, but can cause clearance issues.
- **Material stiffness**: Stiffer = more responsive; softer = more forgiving.
- **Profile**: Shield cut, parabolic, low profile — each alters drag.

---
**7 cm vs 5 cm vs 10 cm**

*   **~5 cm (≈2")**: Fastest, lowest drag; great if your tune is decent. This is the most common indoor “performance” choice (e.g., **AAE WAV 50**).
    
*   **~6 cm (≈2.3–2.4")**: A touch more steering/forgiveness with minimal penalty (e.g., **WAV 60**). If you want a little extra stabilization, pick this.
    
*   **~7 cm (≈2.75")**: Usually **overkill** for your setup. Adds drag and rear mass, typically costs a few fps and a couple of cm more drop at 18 m with no real scoring gain if your tune is good.
    
*   **~10 cm (≈4")**: **Not recommended**—noticeably more drop, louder, more wind sensitivity indoors (!) and more clearance risk. Old-school feel, modern setups don’t need it.

**If you want even more stability (without long vanes)**

Consider 4-fletch of short vanes (e.g., 4 × 50 mm low-profile). It increases steering and forgiveness more efficiently than a single 7–10 cm vane, while keeping height low for clearance. Expect a slight speed/drop penalty; keep glue light.

---

### 3.2 Practical Indoor Barebow Vane Choices

**Recommendations for 18m, 3-fletch:**
- Length: 50–60 mm.
- Height: ~7–8 mm.
- Profile: Parabolic or low-profile shield.
- Type: Molded vanes (AAE WAV, Bohning X Vane, Flex-Fletch).

**Example Vane Models (50 mm)**

| Brand | Model | Length | Height | Weight | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| AAE | WAV 50 | 50 mm | 7.1 mm | 1.7 gr | Excellent clearance |
| Bohning | X Vane 1.75" | 44.5 mm | 7.6 mm | 1.5 gr | Soft, quiet |
| Flex-Fletch | FFP-187 | 47.5 mm | 8 mm | 1.9 gr | Durable |
| Gas Pro | GP-200 | 50 mm | 7.0 mm | 1.8 gr | Mid-profile |

**Example Vane Models (60 mm)**

| Brand | Model | Length | Height | Weight | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| AAE | WAV 60 | 60 mm | 7.3 mm | 1.9 gr | Stable indoors |
| Bohning | X Vane 2.0" | 50.8 mm | 7.6 mm | 1.7 gr | Slightly shorter than name |
| Flex-Fletch | FFP-225 | 57 mm | 8.4 mm | 2.3 gr | High steer |
| Gas Pro | GP-280 | 60 mm | 7.0 mm | 2.0 gr | Forgiving indoors |


**Setup tips**

- **Offset/helical:** ~**1.5–2°** is enough; too much can cause contact.
- **Orientation:** cock vane out, confirm clearance with powder/lipstick test on the shelf/plunger.
- **Glue weight:** light and even; excess glue adds rear mass and reduces FOC.
- **Paper test:** verify no vane contact; adjust nocking point/plunger if needed.

## 4. Other Tuning Considerations

### 4.1 Barebow Spine Chart Adjustment
- Add **~4 lbs** to measured draw weight when using manufacturer spine charts.
- Example: 37 lbs measured → choose spine for 41 lbs.

### 4.2 Brace Height for Barebow
- Riser recommendation: 22–24 cm (your 23.6 cm is within optimal range).
- Lower brace height = more power stroke = potentially stiffer arrow reaction.
- Higher brace height = quieter, softer reaction, but shorter power stroke.

### 4.3 Maintenance Tips
- Store arrows away from heat to prevent vane warping.
- Rotate arrows in shooting order.
- Use powder/lipstick clearance tests before final fletching batch.
- Record exact arrow build: spine, length, point weight, vane model, wrap type.

## 5. Summary Table — Indoor Barebow 18m

| Component | Recommended Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Shaft | 650 spine, carbon, OD 6–7.5 mm | Full carbon preferred |
| Point weight | 120–140 gr | Higher FOC, more stability |
| Vane length | 50–60 mm | Molded vanes, 3-fletch |

**Final Tip**: 
For **barebow indoor**, stability > speed. 
Choose slightly weaker spine, heavier points, and larger vanes to get forgiving groups and easier tuning.
