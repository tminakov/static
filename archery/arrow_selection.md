# Arrow Selection & Tuning Guide
*A Reference for Indoor & Outdoor Barebow Archery*

---

## Introduction

This guide combines both theoretical understanding and practical experience in selecting and tuning arrows for **barebow recurve archery**. 
It covers:
- **Shafts** — how spine, material, and diameter influence flight.
- **Points** — how weight impacts dynamic spine, stability, and grouping.
- **Vanes** — aerodynamic effects of size, height, and stiffness.
- **Other factors** — riser considerations, barebow-specific tuning, maintenance.

It is based on tuning work for a **37 lb draw weight (on the fingers)**, 30.5" arrow length, **600–650 spine carbon shafts**, and focuses on **18m indoor barebow shooting**.

## 1. Shafts

### 1.1 Theoretical Background
The arrow shaft serves as the flexible beam between the bowstring and the target. 
Its most important characteristics:

#### Spine
- Measured as the **deflection** (in thousandths of an inch) under a standard load (1.94 lbs at 28" span).
- **Lower number = stiffer shaft** (e.g., 500 is stiffer than 700).
- Dynamic spine is affected by:
 - Shaft length — longer = weaker.
 - Point weight — heavier = weaker.
 - String material & brace height — faster release stiffens dynamic spine.

#### Material
- **Carbon**: light, straight, durable, immune to bending, consistent.
- **Aluminium**: heavier, easy to bend, but precise and good for indoor line-cutting.
- **AC hybrids**: combine aluminium core with carbon wrap; expensive but top-tier performance.

#### Diameter (ID / OD)
- Smaller OD reduces wind drag, but in indoor archery large OD increases line-cutting potential.
- ID determines component compatibility (nocks, points, pin systems).

### 1.2 Practical Indoor Shaft Selection

**For 18m Barebow (your specs)**:
- Material: **Full carbon** preferred for durability.
- OD: **6–7.5 mm** for line-cutting advantage without excessive wind drag.
- Spine: 650 (± one step) for your draw weight and length.
- Shaft length: Keep at full draw length + ~1–1.5 cm to allow tuning flexibility.

**Example Shaft Models**
| Brand | Model | Spine Options | OD | ID | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------------|----|----|-------|
| Victory | VAP V1 | 600, 650, 700 | ~5.6 mm | 4.2 mm | High precision, small OD |
| Victory | VFT | 600 | ~7.3 mm | ~6.2 mm | High precision, larger OD, 6.6G PI |
| Fivics | TenPro | 600, 650 | ~6.0 mm | 4.2 mm | Affordable, consistent |
| Gas Pro | GS Indoor | 600, 650 | 7.2 mm | 4.2 mm | Large OD, indoor focus |
| Skylon | Paragon | 600, 650 | ~5.8 mm | 4.2 mm | Good ACE alternative |

## 2. Points

### 2.1 Theory

**Role of the point**:
- Adds mass to the arrow front.
- Affects arrow flex during acceleration.
- Changes **Front of Center (FOC)** balance — higher FOC improves stability, lower FOC increases speed.

**Dynamic spine effect**:
- More point weight = arrow bends more = weaker dynamic spine.
- This can make an arrow group tighter at short range but slower overall.

**Optimal indoor tuning**:
- Slightly weaker dynamic spine is often more forgiving indoors.
- High FOC helps the arrow “settle” faster in flight.

### 2.2 Practical Data

**Your setup example**:
- 30.5" VFT 600 spine carbon shaft.
- 120 grain points for indoor stability.

| Point (gr) | Dynamic Spine Shift* | Speed | Forgiveness |
|------------|----------------------|-------|-------------|
| 80         | +0.004" stiffer | Highest | Lowest |
| 100        | ~Neutral | High | Balanced |
| 120        | -0.006" weaker | Medium | High |
| 140        | -0.009" weaker | Lowest | Very High |

## 3. Vanes

### 3.1 Theory

**Purpose**: Vanes stabilise the arrow by creating drag and rotational spin. 
They must balance:
- Clearance (avoiding contact with rest, riser, or tab).
- Aerodynamic stability.
- Minimal speed loss.

**Variables**:
- **Length**: Longer vanes give more stability but more drag.
- **Height**: Higher vanes catch more air, but can cause clearance issues.
- **Material stiffness**: Stiffer = more responsive; softer = more forgiving.
- **Profile**: Shield cut, parabolic, low profile — each alters drag.

---

### 3.2 Practical Indoor Barebow Vane Choices

**Recommendations for 18m, 3-fletch:**
- Length: 50–60 mm.
- Height: ~7–8 mm.
- Profile: Parabolic or low-profile shield.
- Type: Molded vanes (AAE WAV, Bohning X Vane, Flex-Fletch).

**Example Vane Models (50 mm)**

| Brand | Model | Length | Height | Weight | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| AAE | WAV 50 | 50 mm | 7.1 mm | 1.7 gr | Excellent clearance |
| Bohning | X Vane 1.75" | 44.5 mm | 7.6 mm | 1.5 gr | Soft, quiet |
| Flex-Fletch | FFP-187 | 47.5 mm | 8 mm | 1.9 gr | Durable |
| Gas Pro | GP-200 | 50 mm | 7.0 mm | 1.8 gr | Mid-profile |

**Example Vane Models (60 mm)**

| Brand | Model | Length | Height | Weight | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| AAE | WAV 60 | 60 mm | 7.3 mm | 1.9 gr | Stable indoors |
| Bohning | X Vane 2.0" | 50.8 mm | 7.6 mm | 1.7 gr | Slightly shorter than name |
| Flex-Fletch | FFP-225 | 57 mm | 8.4 mm | 2.3 gr | High steer |
| Gas Pro | GP-280 | 60 mm | 7.0 mm | 2.0 gr | Forgiving indoors |

## 4. Other Tuning Considerations

### 4.1 Barebow Spine Chart Adjustment
- Add **~4 lbs** to measured draw weight when using manufacturer spine charts.
- Example: 37 lbs measured → choose spine for 41 lbs.

### 4.2 Brace Height for Barebow
- Riser recommendation: 22–24 cm (your 23.6 cm is within optimal range).
- Lower brace height = more power stroke = potentially stiffer arrow reaction.
- Higher brace height = quieter, softer reaction, but shorter power stroke.

### 4.3 Maintenance Tips
- Store arrows away from heat to prevent vane warping.
- Rotate arrows in shooting order.
- Use powder/lipstick clearance tests before final fletching batch.
- Record exact arrow build: spine, length, point weight, vane model, wrap type.

## 5. Summary Table — Indoor Barebow 18m

| Component | Recommended Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Shaft | 650 spine, carbon, OD 6–7.5 mm | Full carbon preferred |
| Point weight | 120–140 gr | Higher FOC, more stability |
| Vane length | 50–60 mm | Molded vanes, 3-fletch |
| Brace height | 23–24 cm | Within riser spec |
| Arrow length | 30.5" | Full draw length + margin |

---

**Final Tip**: 
For **barebow indoor**, stability > speed. 
Choose slightly weaker spine, heavier points, and larger vanes to get forgiving groups and easier tuning.
